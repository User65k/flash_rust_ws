A Webserver written in Rust.
Build on the speedy [Hyper](https://hyper.rs/).

# Usage

## Installation

[Install cargo](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and then:
`cargo install --git https://github.com/User65k/flash_rust_ws.git`

## Running

Create a config file and execute the binary :relaxed:

See the [Wiki](https://github.com/User65k/flash_rust_ws/wiki) for some help with the config file.

You will need at least a single [Host](https://github.com/User65k/flash_rust_ws/wiki/virtual-host) containing a [Mount Path](https://github.com/User65k/flash_rust_ws/wiki/mount-path).

Minimal Example:

```toml
["example.com"]
ip = "127.0.0.1:80"
dir = "/var/www/"
```

Let's Encrypt Example:
```toml
["example.com"]
ip = "[::]:443"
validate_server_name = true
dir = "/var/www/"
tls.host.ACME = {uri="https://acme-staging-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory",cache_dir=".",contact=["mailto:admin@example.com"]}
```
